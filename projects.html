                <h2>My Projects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walmart Sales Analysis | MySQL:</strong> Extracted insights to enhance product strategy, customer behavior analysis, and operational efficiency. Processed and cleaned 1,000 records and 16 features, added time-based features, and conducted analysis using aggregate functions and CASE statements. The insights revealed "Food and beverages" as the top revenue generator, Branch C as the most profitable, and cash as the dominant payment method, providing a solid foundation for optimizing inventory, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diabetes Risk Prediction | Python:</strong> Built a predictive model to identify high-risk diabetic patients for early intervention. Processed 253,000+ records, performed statistical analysis, addressed class imbalance, conducted feature engineering, and implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with cross-validation. Selected Logistic Regression (71.26% accuracy, 74.28% recall) over XGBoost (85.76% accuracy, 11.72% recall) to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives, ensuring better detection of at-risk patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>RSVP Movies - Movie Data Analysis | SQL:</strong> Analyzed movie data, identified top genres, and recommended leading production houses, high-rating movies, and popular directors to boost revenue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing Price Prediction | Python:</strong> Built a 91% accurate linear regression model using Scikit-learn. Conducted EDA and feature engineering to identify key factors for property valuation and pricing.</li>
                    <li><strong>OTT Platform Analysis | Enginius:</strong> Utilized marketing analytics software for user segmentation and competitive positioning, concluding that genre-based differentiation might not optimize OTT platform strategies.</li>
